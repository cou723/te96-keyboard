Expandable keyboard PCB with a smaller pitch.

## What is the te96?

The te96 is a keyboard board that can be assembled and expanded in the same way as the [SU120](https://github.com/e3w2q/su120-keyboard), but with a smaller pitch.

I designed the PCB to make it easy to trial and error a smaller pitch keyboard layout.

You may make Row-Staggered, Column-Staggerd, Ortholinear layouts keyboard.

The "te"(手) is named after the Japanese word for 手助け(help) and 手に馴染む(comfort).

## Why open source?

Anyone interested in keyboard could try the keyboard layout more easily.
